                            derive thrust force in 1D planar coordinates. The electric current density in the model can be expressed in the form of Mott-Gurney law. After the

                            but this requires a complex and failure-prone mechanism. A simpler alternative is electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrust, which requires no moving mechanical
                            parts. In EHD, corona discharge generates a flow of ions in an electric field between two electrodes; the high-velocity ions transfer their kinetic
                            energy to neutral air molecules through collisions, accelerating the gas and creating thrust. In this study, we utilize laser machining fabrication to
                            build EHD thrusters for centimeter-sized aerial robots. The process allows for use of a greater variety of electrode materials and eliminates the need
                            for a cleanroom facility. For example, it allows fabricating a complete four-thruster device in a matter of minutes. Our four-thruster device measures
                            1.8 × 2.5 cm and is composed of steel emitters and a lightweight carbon fiber mesh. We measured the electrical current and thrust of each thruster of
                            our four-thruster design, showing agreement with the Townsend relation. The device was able to lift its weight, as indicated by thrust measurements and
                            free-flight connected to a wire tether. The thrust-to-weight ratio of our device at takeoff voltage of 4.6 kV is 1.38 with a power consumption of 0.037 W.
                            The peak thrust-to-weight ratio of our thruster at the maximum actuation voltage of 5.2 kV (with a typical operating range of 3.6 kV to 5.2 kV) is 3.03
                            with a power consumption of 0.104 W.

                            The EHD phenomena has many potential engineering applications but requires a mechanistic understanding of the ion and flow transport. The EHD device consists of two electrodes flush mounted on the surface
                            to create an airflow along the plate. Constant current hotwire anemometry is used to measure the flow velocity profile. The applied voltage between the electrodes is varied and the resulting effects in the
                            charge density and flow field are measured. The airflow near the wall acts a jet and it reaches a maximum of 2 m/s with an energy conversion efficiency of ~3%. The velocity decreases sharply as we move
                            vertically from the plate. Multiphysics numerical model couples ion transport equation and the Navier Stokes equations to solve for the spatiotemporal distribution of electric field, charge density and
                            flow field. The numerical results match experimental data shedding new insights into mass, charge and momentum transport phenomena. The EHD driven flow can be applied to the design of new plasma actuators for flow control.

                                the results are compared with experimental velocity profiles at the exit. Experimentally evaluated particle transmission trends for ambient and
                                NaCl nanoparticles in the 20 nm–150 nm range are in good agreement with the theoretical models. However, for particles in the
                                10 nm–20 nm size range, the transmission is lower due to the increased particle charging resulted from their exposure to the high-intensity
                                electric field and high charge density in the EHD driven flow. These conditions yield a high probability of particles below 20 nm to
                                acquire and hold a unit charge. The transmission is lower for smaller particle (10 nm) due to their high charge to mass ratio, and
                                it increases as the single-charged particles grow in mass up to 20 nm, resulting in their lower electrical mobility. For particles
                                larger than 20 nm, the electrical mobility increases again as they can acquire multiple charges. The results shed insight into
                                interaction of nanoparticle and ions in high electrical field environment, that occur in primary EHD driven flows and in the secondary
                                flows generated by corona discharge.

                            and numerically and EHD flow serves as a primary particle sampling mechanism. Multiphysics numerical model couples ion transport equation and
                            the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) to solve for the spatiotemporal distribution of electric field, charge density, and flow field;
                            the results are compared with experimental velocity profiles at the exit. Experimentally evaluated particle transmission trends for ambient and
                            NaCl nanoparticles in the 20 nm–150 nm range are in good agreement with the theoretical models. However, for particles in the
                            10 nm–20 nm size range, the transmission is lower due to the increased particle charging resulted from their exposure to the high-intensity
                            electric field and high charge density in the EHD driven flow. These conditions yield a high probability of particles below 20 nm to
                            acquire and hold a unit charge. The transmission is lower for smaller particle (10 nm) due to their high charge to mass ratio, and
                            it increases as the single-charged particles grow in mass up to 20 nm, resulting in their lower electrical mobility. For particles
                            larger than 20 nm, the electrical mobility increases again as they can acquire multiple charges. The results shed insight into
                            interaction of nanoparticle and ions in high electrical field environment, that occur in primary EHD driven flows and in the secondary
                            flows generated by corona discharge.
